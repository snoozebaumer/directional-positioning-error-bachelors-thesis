___

## Scripts and chapter they're first used in
### Chapter 5.2 - preparation for analysis
- [data_profiling.py](data_profiling.py): used in data quality assessment for sanity check to make sure data makes sense as well as find errors with some general analysis
#### Chapter 5.2.3 - calculated attributes
- [calculate_distance.py](calculate_distance.py): calculates distance using haversine formula, used to generate the distances between actual location and gps location that is needed for analysis
### Chapter 6.2 - analysis
- [boxplot.py](boxplot.py): used to generate box plots of entire data
#### Chapter 6.2.1 Correlation of numerical attributes
- [correlation_numerical.py](correlation_numerical.py): calculates the correlation for numerical attributes and target attributes latDifference, lonDifference and distance using pearson correlation
#### Chapter 6.2.2 Correlation of categorical and boolean attributes
- [correlation_boolean_categorical.py](correlation_boolean_categorical.py): creates boolean attributes for categorical attributes, in the style of vector space model, then calculates the correlation for boolean attributes and target attributes latDifference, lonDifference and distance using point-biserial correlation
#### Chapter 6.2.3 Measurement locations
- [polar_plots.py](polar_plots.py): plots the direction of each error for all locations (and stages, they are shown in chapter 6.3.3).
#### Chapter 6.2.5 minimum and maximum distance to measure location
- [plot_distances_for_series.py](plot_distances_for_series.py): splits up the data into series of 20 measurements and plots graphs for series
#### Chapter 6.2.6 - inaccurate first measurement
- [first_measurement_vs_median_measurement.py](first_measurement_vs_median_measurement.py): calculates the difference between distance of first measurement in series to actual location and median measurement to actual location, then plots them
