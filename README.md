# Bachelor's thesis - Directional Positioning Error
scripts and generated / edited data for my Bachelor's thesis at HSLU spring semester 2024, concerning a possible directional positioning error in smartphone GPS
____
new data can be generated by using the Android app that was also part of this bachelor's thesis:
[Measuralyze](https://github.com/snoozebaumer/measuralyze)
___

## Scripts and chapter they're first used in
### Chapter 5.2 - preparation for analysis
- [data_profiling.py](data_profiling.py): used in data quality assessment for sanity check to make sure data makes sense as well as find errors with some general analysis
#### Chapter 5.2.4 - calculated attributes
- [calculate_distance.py](calculate_distance.py): calculates distance using haversine formula, used to generate the distances between actual location and gps location that is needed for analysis
### Chapter 6.2 - analysis
- [boxplot.py](boxplot.py): used to generate box plots of entire data
- [correlation_numerical.py](correlation_numerical.py): calculates the correlation for numerical attributes and target attributes latDifference, lonDifference and distance using pearson correlation
- [correlation_boolean_categorical.py](correlation_boolean_categorical.py): creates boolean attributes for categorical attributes, in the style of vector space model, then calculates the correlation for boolean attributes and target attributes latDifference, lonDifference and distance using point-biserial correlation
- [plot_distances_for_series.py](plot_distances_for_series.py): splits up the data into series of 20 measurements and plots graphs for series
- [r2_analysis](r2_analysis.py): generates r2 score for whole dataset, not mentioned in thesis
#### Chapter 6.2.1 - inaccurate first measurement
- [first_measurement_vs_median_measurement.py](first_measurement_vs_median_measurement.py): calculates the difference between distance of first measurement in series to actual location and median measurement to actual location, then plots them
